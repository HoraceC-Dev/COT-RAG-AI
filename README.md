# Humanlized-RAG-System

This project introduces a new chatbot model that combines ChatGPT and a custom-built Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. 
The chatbot can solve complex decision trees related to a specific domain, mimicking human-like decision-making.
This approach offers an effective fine-tuning solution, reducing the need for high-cost retraining processes.

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- **Flexibility**: Given a set of executable workflows, the chatbot is capable of fulfilling queries in various fields.
- **Backend Integration**: Connects the chatbot to a backend system (e.g., a database or a third-party API) to fetch dynamic data.
- **Generative AI**: Leverages OpenAI's models to provide human-like responses to user queries.
- **Scalability**: Leverages the RAG system to retrieve decision flows for corresponding queries using a single Generative AI model.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: The chatbot can maintain conversational context for more natural interactions.
