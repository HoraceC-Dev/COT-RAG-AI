# AI Integration in Customer Service: Addressing the Limitations with RAG

Nowadays, companies have been introducing AI and various algorithms in the form of chatbots to enhance customer experience. a noticeable and significant gap remains between chatbots and actual human agents. Specifically, chatbots often struggle with:
- Understanding complex or nuanced customer queries where they involve multiple decision trees.
- Handling unexpected or edge-case scenarios.
- Adapting to the context or history of customer interactions, a common limitation in traditional algorithm-driven chatbots.

This project addresses these challenges and aims to develop a more comprehensive chatbot model. The solution integrates the capabilities of pre-trained models like ChatGPT with a custom-built Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
RAG is a commonly used technique for GPT models to improve the accuracy of information by providing access to an external knowledge base.
Secondly, it offers a means to expand the scope of the model's responses without fine-tuning or training on every single piece of information.

## Customized RAG
In the world of RAG, there are numerous ways to implement RAG systems with models like GPT. I have developed a new system that leverages semantic search to handle complex customer service queries.

My system works as follows:

- **Customer Queries**: Complex customer service queries are encoded into semantic embeddings, which capture the meaning of the query instead of just the literal words.
  
- **Semantic Search**: The encoded query is used to perform a semantic similarity search in an external database containing a collection of past customer service issues and their corresponding solutions.

- **Workflows (SOPs)**: The retrieved values are a question associated with **workflows** (Standard Operating Procedures or SOPs), which guide the model through the necessary steps to resolve the issue.

### Features of Enhanced RAG-Based Model
- **Reliability**: The chatbot is capable of adhering strictly to the predefined workflow like the standard algorithm-driven models.
- **Flexibility**: The integration of GPT enables the model to respond adaptively depending on the scenario, simulating human-like decision-making.
